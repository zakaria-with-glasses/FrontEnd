# 🧪 My First React Frontend Project

This is the **first frontend** I ever built using **React.js**.  
I created it a long time ago, back when I had **no experience** in frontend development, and wanted to get my hands dirty with something practical.

## 📝 About

At the time, I was just experimenting — no tutorials, no frameworks, just diving in.  
This project was my attempt to:

- Understand how React works
- Build components and pass props
- Play with state and basic interactivity
- Learn by doing

It’s far from perfect, but I’m keeping it public as a reminder of where I started and how far I’ve come.
